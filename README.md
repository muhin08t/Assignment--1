### 2. What is Event Bubble and Event Delegation in JS?
    Event Bubble:  Event bubbling is a concept in JavaScript that describes how events propagate through the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. When an event occurs on an element, it does not just affect that element, but also its parent elements, all the way up to the root of the DOM tree. 


    Event Delegation: Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript used to handle events efficiently. Instead of attaching event listeners to multiple child elements, you attach a single event listener to a parent element. When an event is triggered on a child element, it bubbles up to the parent element, where the event listener can handle it.

### 3. What is the difference between localstorage , session storage and cookies.
    LocalStorage: Persistent storage across sessions and tabs, scoped to the domain.
    SessionStorage: Temporary storage for the duration of the page session, scoped to the tab or window.
    Cookies: Small pieces of data sent with every HTTP request, can be persistent or session-based, scoped to the domain and path.

### 4. In CSS what is the difference between display inline , display inline block and display block?
    Display inline: Elements do not start on a new line, ignore width and height properties, and can sit next to each other.
    Display inline-block: Elements do not start on a new line, respect width and height properties, and can sit next to each other.
    Display block: Elements start on a new line, take up the full available width by default, and push other elements to a new line.
